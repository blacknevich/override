start ssh connection with ssh -p 4242 level03@127.0.0.1 with flag from lvl2

see the program with gdb (see source) - main conclusions:

the value that we input is a substrahend from 322424845 in test function

if the resulting value is more then 21 other steps will be randomized and we will not have an impact on the program

if the result is less the 0 result will overflow which is almost the same so we work with 0-21 range. At this point we can already make a hack but we can be a little more cool

the result of substraction is then passed to decrypt funtion which makes an operation of 0xff & ( X ^ (322424845 - input_string)) for each letter of the string "Q}|u`sfg~sf{}|a3" 

it compares the resulting string with "Congratulations!" string and runs bin/sh in case of success

we cat make a key finder program that replicates the original one (see at the Resources folder)

the key value is 18 and the full input string is 322424827

we have a password that matches!
