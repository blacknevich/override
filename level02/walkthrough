start ssh connection with ssh -p 4242 level02@127.0.0.1 with flag from lvl1

see the function with gdb (see source) - helps to understand stack offset understanding but actually only 1 thing matters:
focus attention on string 250 of source file - it is printf(username), we can exploit with a format string!

format string exploit construction is: for(( i = 1; i < 100; i++)); do echo "%$i\$p" | ./level02 | grep does; done

$x in printf means that we want input from x's variable of printf - so we will have first 100 pointers in hexademical

answers somewhere around 20-30 look suspicious, turn them to ascii from hex and reverse with little endian: see decoder.sh file in Resourse foulder

we have a flag that matches! (program doesn't care about username)
