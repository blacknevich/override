start ssh connection with ssh -p 4242 level06@127.0.0.1 use flag from level05

the programm to exploit is (see source):
enter login and serial, it creates a key in auth function with a complicated algorithm and compares it to the serial
in case of success we have our bin/bash launched

we can enter a login and watch at gdb the value compared to our serial and then just enter it!

it is very important that we have a ptrace check of -1 variable that idicates the debugging mode and prevents it from running
we can deal with it buy the following code in gdb:
catch syscall ptrace
commands $catchpoint_number
set $eax=0
continue
end
it catches the ptraces attempt to indicate an error end changes -1 to 0 so we are ok!

then just set a brekpoint at b *0x08048866 and see the variable x/d $ebp-16
6233775 for nscarab
6233785 for nmisfit
success!

go to the level07 folder and check flag in .pass!
